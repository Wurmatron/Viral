# What is it?

Simple put its a imaginary "Virus". It simple has no actual relation in real life.
The closest would be some highly infectious air-born something. I'm no biologist.

# How it Works

It spreads in a radius of `8` blocks by default. It can infect all mobs except players, however different types of mobs are affect differently.

`Hostile` Mobs gain

  - 2x max health

  - Strength

  - Resistance

  - Speed Lvl 2

`Passive` Mobs get

  - Slowness lvl 4

  - 1 hp damage every 1000 world ticks (~60 seconds)
